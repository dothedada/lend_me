# Lend me

A small app to keep track of the books you lend with your friends... It was made to exercise and improve my habillities in express and postgresql, tackling a little ot data validation, cookies, jwt and user flow.

## Routes roadmap

- ~log (kind of login)~
- ~home (Dashboard, my books, lended book)~
- ~Books (books that i can lend, search for books in my circle, add to lib, remove from lib)~
- ~detail pages (book, author, editorial, category)~
- ~friends (add, remove friends, accept friend requests)~
- ~add book~
- ~lends (requested lends, accept, lends history)~
- ~profile (edit profile, remove my account, remove books (users, lends, requests))~
- log dead user?
- input validations and error handling
- ~style the shit up~
- notas de aprendizaje (JWT)
- make documentation and tests?
